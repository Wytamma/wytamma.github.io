## In 2025 I set my self the challenge of building 52 apps

I've decided to set my self the challenge of building 52 apps in 2025. I'm not sure if I'll be able to complete it but I'm going to give it a try.

## Apps

1. [Visualizing All ISBNs](https://blog.wytamma.com/isbns/) - annas-archive $10,000 bounty
2. [cat.wytamma.com](https://cat.wytamma.com/) - Client side app to concatenate multiple files into one
3. [replace.wytamma.com](https://replace.wytamma.com/) - Use a CSV/TSV file to perform multiple find and replace operations
4. [sciscroller.wytamma.com](https://sciscroller.wytamma.com/) -  Explore scientific papers in a scrollable tiktok like format
5. [river](https://blog.wytamma.com/river/) - Client side torrent streaming (try 08ada5a7a6183aae1e09d831df6748d566095a10)
6. [skygrid](https://github.com/Wytamma/skygrid) - CLI Tool for automating skygrid analyses in BEAST

9. [Pixi-pack install script action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pixi-pack-action) - Using the above action and this one I've created what I'm calling the poor person's personal package index.
10. [CPG Bioinformatics Portal](https://portal.cpg.unimelb.edu.au/) - This is a massive project - I think it counts for 10!
11. [Marcel Ball](https://editor.p5js.org/wytamma/full/BryAAtSPd) - Pong-like game I created with my Niphew.
