Here are a few post I've made about the ongoing pandemic. 

## 20th of October 2021 - Vaccines

We are marching towards reopening, however, when we do everything will not return to normal. There will be more lockdowns and more deaths, but there will be less deaths than if we didn’t live in a world that gets to reap the benefits of modern science.

Vaccines are not perfect, anyone who tells you that is lying. However, vaccines are the best defence we’ve got right now (and probably will ever have). Vaccines help reduce the spread of covid, they will not stop the spread. But reduced spread means less pressure on hospitals. The vaccine will reduce your risk of severe disease when you get covid. You are far less like to die if you are vaccinated, but you could still get sick. If you have the opportunity, get vaccinated now.
For those of you in remote or regional areas that haven’t experienced much disruption. I’m sorry but covid is coming for you. This virus is here to stay, eventually everyone will be infected. As the world reopens there will be more and more spillover until the virus is endemic globally. If you live somewhere they get the common cold, you’ll eventually get a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

If you’re already vaccinated you should know that you will have to get more jabs. It might be a booster or new vaccine for different variants, but you’ll be rolling up your sleeve again, maybe sooner than you think. 

Pretty soon, a lot of people who die from covid will be vaccinated. This makes sense, if everyone is vaccinated then everyone who gets covid will be vaccinated, and therefore everyone who dies from covid will be vaccinated. This is not to say the vaccines don’t work, they reduce your risk of dying, but they are not 100%. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that the vaccines are ineffective just because vaccinated people are dying or getting sick. 

This is a long way from over, but things are definitely looking better than they were.

## 28th of September 2020 - 1 million deaths

Today we passed 1 million covid-19 deaths. It's a number with a magnitude I struggle to comprehend. We have been doing reasonably well here in Australia, but this is a pandemic, it is a global problem that requires effort from everyone. Going forward, we know that testing and isolation work. If you feel sick, get tested. Physically distance yourself from unnecessary contact but don't socially distance. Vaccines are coming, but they're still a while away. Although this sounds bleak, it's not the end. Cherish any time with reduced restriction, it may not last, and with 1 million fewer lives in the world, it is worth cherishing every last bit.

## 24th of April 2020 - This Is Not News 

In this episode of This Is Not News I sit down with Wytamma Wirth who is a current PHD Student at JCU Townsville.  He has a Bachelor degree in Biochemistry, Honours in Microbiology & Immunology and is currently completing his PHD in Epidemiology & Pathology.

In this episode we discuss what is known about the Novel Coronavirus, the race to find a Vaccine, possible options till we find a Vaccine, how the virus causes its symptoms, mutations in the virus plus more.

## 3rd of March 2020 - Pandemic

As the total number for coronavirus cases approaches 100,000 it's time to prepare but not panic. It is likely that the world health organisation will soon declare a pandemic. Indeed, Australia has already put it's emergency health response plan into action (the trigger is a likely pandemic). This will not be a zombie apocalypse, but you may experience some disruption to your daily activities. Sick people will need to be isolated to reduce the spread of the virus. That means that people won't show up for work and things will slow down for a little while. We are already seeing some disruption to supply chains. With this in mind it's important to be prepared if you need to spend some time indoors. Have nonperishable food for everyone in your house and a months worth of any prescription medication. There is no imminent threat to your health, but a few extra cans of baked beans can't hurt.

Some things to remember:
- Racism will not protect you from this virus.
- Dab when you sneeze.
- Wash your hands regularly.
- Give sick people a metre distance (this virus is not airborne but you can get it from fluids e.g. in a sneeze).
- You are still more likely to die from the flu (GET YOUR FLU SHOT!!).

## 24th of January 2020 - In the beginning 

I thought I should say something about the current coronavirus out break from China. There is a lot of panic in the media because this is a novel virus, however, the risk to yourself is still very low compared to something like the flu. Last year in Queensland alone the flu killed 264 people. Wash your hands regularly, cover your nose (dab) when you sneeze, and don't panic. 

Your virologist friend,

Wytamma 

P.S. It's also probably a good idea to avoid live animal markets in Central China for a little while.
